        <h4>1. Notes</h4>
        All of the notes that user creates are stored in the users device. The notes can't be accessed by any other app on the phone. 
        The only way to access the notes is to use the users phone. 
        To be clear: the app doesn't sends data to any third party server. 
        The data is only stored in the user's device and no where else.
        Although this document may seem long, that (in the author's opinion) is the most important information.

        The Notes up is a simple notes taking application that helps users to store
        information on their own devices. The application <span>does not send any data</span> to 
        any service or collects any amount of user data. It can be run without 
        internet.

        <h4>2. Contact information</h4>
        Using the "email" in the app will open an email app and allow to send an email to karan.vish17@gmail.com. 
        After receiving an email the user's address will be used to answer any question or problems related to the app. 
        Email addresses are not stored anywhere outside the email service provider used by the developer (gmail.com). The developer does not collect email addresses.
